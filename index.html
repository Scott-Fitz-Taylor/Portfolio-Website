<p>Hello! My name is Scott Fitz Taylor and welcome to 'Great Scott! Productions'.</p>
<p>This website's purpose is to display my portfolio of creative work, which focuses around story-telling, creative writing and ad concepts.</p>
<p>This also includes text-based interactive narratives made in Twine and Python, traditional written prose and even board games!</p>
<p>You can also consider this website itself as part of this portfolio too as it was created entirely by myself through HTML and CSS. Enjoy! :)</p></div>
