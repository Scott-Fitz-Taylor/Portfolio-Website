<p>Hello again. This page is to give you an insight into who I am for those that are interested. I would say with confidence that my #1 'talent' would be coming up with great ideas, which my portfolio should hopefully give some sense of. This could be in any context but especially in the creative space. The reason this is valuable is because the whole world is run on ideas, everything can be traced back to that initial thought or spark of creativity and imgination. Generally speaking, the world needs people who can come up with good ideas, otherwise, in my opinion, we as a species simply would not advance/evolve. Of course, what would an idea, as creative as it may be, be without it's execution? Valuable, sure, but nowhere near as valuable as it would be without it being properly utilised and realised through well-executed technique. This is why I have made a continous effort to improve my ability in creative writing through my own practise as well as doing so during my English and Creative Writing degree, which I got a 2:1 in! I have also completed online courses in 'Game's Narrative Design' as well as Code Nation's 'Develop Coding' course, both of which have taught me greatly about how to go about writing and coding story-based games (amongst other technological knowledge) with different languages (e.g. Python, HTML and CSS etc.). My portfolio will display what I have learned thus far--with future projects being added--which will hopefully display the kind of person I am, what I am capable of as well as the great potential I have. Thank you for reading! :) </p></div>
