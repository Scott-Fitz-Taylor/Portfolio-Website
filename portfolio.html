<div id="text2"><h2>Portfolio:</h2>
<p>Welcome to my creative portfolio. Below is a list of some of my favourite pieces of work I have done over the years. Enjoy!</p></div>
<br>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ibk1ZpP-F4lEaOAtJvL29yfBxAbILNw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><div id="img4"><img src="Logo thumbnail.png"></a></div></a><p>Logo concept sub-portfolio: Click the image on the left to view a compilation of the logo design concepts that I created using Canva. The first set of concepts were made while I was working for TV personality Raj Bisram (known by Antiques Roadshow and Bargain Hunt fame) as a marketing intern. These concepts were developed over several weeks where I recieved weekly feedback regarding requested changes/updates until a final design was decided upon by my team to be used as their new brand logo! Other concepts within this document also include designs for Rockstar Spirits (a brand I worked with for my course's Live Client Brief--seen below) and my sister's fashion knitwear brand.</p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OZRhgTQXELi0Jev3CxMshpYeFXPzM6ZP/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><div id="img"><img src="Rockstar-Logo.jpg"></a></div></a><p>Rockstar Spirits Live Client Brief Report: During my master's course, I was allocated into a group of peers to work for a real-life client in order to create an advertisting/marketing plan that answers the client's brief. This involved creating a report of our proposed strategy which was then summarised into a powerpoint presentation that we pitched in front of the client, our tutors, and everyone on our course. The client that we worked for was a Manchester-based spiced rum brand called 'Rockstar Spirits', which famously won the backing of two investors on Dragon's Den. Over several months, our team met with the client, owner Tom Hurst, to develop a creative response to the problems that Rockstar Spirits face. Some of these problems were identified in the brief and our meetings with Tom Hurst as well as through our primary and secondary research. Our primary research involved holding several focus groups with people that fit our decided 24-41-years-old target audience. Our secondary research involved using market trend reports to get a better understanding of the spirits industry and other 2022 trends that may affect Rockstar Spirits. After all this research, we then developed a creative proposition 'Rum and Reason' that encompases our overall strategy, all of which can be found in the report that can be accessed through clicking on the image on the left.</p></div>

As I had chosen the Trentham Monkey Forest (a local Staffordshire park that allows vistors to walk amongst Barbary macaque monkeys), I was tasked to persuade the target audience of 40-55-year-olds living in Newcastle-Under-Lyme to not only visit the park but to also purchase the park's 'Babies Adoption Pack'; where the proceeds of which would go towards important research and conservation for the endagered Barabry macaque monkey species. This portfolio also ends with an additional 'Theoretical Critique', which will detail my analysis of the ethics regarding Trentham Monkey Forest's current persuasive communication in relation to academic theory. This portfolio also recieved a high Distinction (78)!! Please click on the image (left) to view the full portfolio.</p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eO24ZzseARGlj9S01TTbiguvj9plmCpe_1wa8MiF2q0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><div id="img4"><img src="DogBowl.png"></a></div></a><p>Content Strategy Report, Editorial Calendar and Gantt chart for prioritised two months, and Two Creative Content Mockups for Manchester bar 'Dog Bowl': My Content Strategy Report involved creating a content audit, customer journey template, content/business goals, KPI objectives, and a messaging framework for my chosen distribution channels; all of which then had to be summed up in a single additional sentence known as a Content Strategy Statement (CSS). My CSS was so effective in concisely summarising my content strategy that it was worth my tutor shouting me out on LinkedIn (which can be seen in my reposts on LinkedIn). This report, alongside my detailed editorial calendar, gantt chart, and annotated creative mockups of potential online content Dog Bowl could use (based on the strategy) resulted in me recieving a very high Distinction (87)!! Please click on the image (left) to view the full report with the mockups and a link to the calendar spreadsheet attached within. </p></div>

The brief tasked us with the challenge of making reading more appealing to a younger audience. Click the image on the left to view my 4 A3-sized concept boards that display the ad concepts I made alongside annotations which explain the rationale behind it. The boards also include the idea development that went into my final idea concept, allowing the viewer to better understand the many different ideas that were brought together to make the concept.</p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://thegreatscott.itch.io/meat-shield-wanted" target="_blank"><div id="img"><img src="Title screen 6.jpg"></a></div></a><p>'Meat-Shield: Wanted' = Individual/passion project. This was my first ever attempt at creating a text-based, choose-your-own-adventure-like narrative game, which I did using Twine Harlowe initially for a univeristy project. Soon after starting the project it was clear that I had great visions for this game that were arguablly way too ambitious for someone with no prior knowledge or experience of coding whatsoever to make within a tight deadline. This was especially the case due to my desire to create and add unique artwork and music into the game. However, I was determined to complete it and make it the best game that I could, so I endeavoured every day for several months straight up until the deadline (no exaggeration). In the end I proved myself and the other doubters wrong as I recieved a score higher than a First, that of 80! The game was also chosen by my lecturers to be shown as an exemplar piece to next year's students! Since then it has been a passion project that I have uploaded onto 'itch.io', where I continue to work on it to make improvements. If you wish to check this out then you can access it by clicking the image on the left. Enjoy :)</p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottFitzTaylor" target="_blank"><div id="img5"><img src="OMB.png"></a></div></a><p></p>Creative Advertising Concepts = Sub-Portfolio of work made in spare time. This is my Twitter account which I use exclusivley for hosting and displaying any and all creative advertising concepts that I have made as a hobby of mine for a range of different brands, most of which are made for @OneMinuteBriefs (which is essentially a daily advertising competition) but also work that I have made during my Creative Advertising Strategy Masters. Clicking on it will take you to my Twitter page and my sub-portfolio, which can also be can be accessed through the link in the Contact Me tab.</p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZqnHaL32eI4j9Gb6O5fPcuimYqq5zT4Cl1JBZtDGFo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><div id="imgs"><img src="CW picture.png"></a></div></a><p>Creative Writing Collection = Click the image on the left to be taken to my collection of creative writing pieces that I have done over the years in my spare time. It primarily includes prose/short stories but also includes a screenplay and a poem. For your convenience, you will be able to choose which piece you'd like to read and which page it is on from the first page. From this, you should be able to learn of my writing style and how I have developed over the years through each of my pieces. Also bear in mind that this will be continuously updated with new pieces that I write and would like to add, which will be representative of the fact that the 'writing journey' is also a long and continuous one. These pieces may be terrible for all I know, however, they should hopefully display where I started, how far I've come and what I have learned through writing them. Enjoy :)</p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://trinket.io/python/81f54d65ec?outputOnly=true"target="_blank"><div id="img2"><img src="Dream_Catcher3.png"></div><a></a><p>'The Dream Catcher' = Group project. This python game was made alongside two other people, Humaira and Kyle. We worked together through almost every stage of the planning process as well as certain parts of the game's creation through online communication and daily Zoom meetings. We planned for the game to have multiple different sections/dreams that the player plays through depending on their responses to a 'personality quiz' at the beginning of the game. This means that depending on a player's choices, they will have a different experience to other players as well as on multiple playthroughs, similar to my previous project. To achieve this, each of us split-off from the group to work on three individual sections each, which would be compiled together once written. At the end of the project, we had time to play-test the code to make sure that it worked properly and as intended, however, there were so many problems that I, alone, had to go through each line of code (of the everyone's sections) to correct the errors. Because of my valiant work, I was thereafter titled 'The Sweeper'... by myself. If you wish to play the game, and/or the sections that I made, then click the image on the left and choose the options 'Indoors', 'Fame' and 'The Unknown' when prompted. Enjoy! :) </p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><div id="img3"><img src="A3 PNG-min.png"></div><a></a><p>'Deadlock'/'Stalemate' boardgame (name TBD) = 100% passion project. This is a boardgame that I have been working on for a couple of months now. It is a two player game that is a hybrid beteween a boardgame and a card game. The way that the game works, at least at the moment, is that each player (with their own deck of cards) must place cards in each column while keeping their cards on their side of the river. This is because a player cannot place a card on the opponent's side, however, they can push a card from their side over the river using another one of their cards (as long as they use the appropriate card to push what is on the board). You must do this while the opponent is pushing their cards onto your side or pushing your advanced cards back. What will soon happen is a constant back and forth between both players in each column until one player successfully pushes a card off the board on the opponent's side, winning them a point. The first player to win the most columns/points wins the game. To add extra strategy, there are special cards (e.g. Jack and Queen) that have their own abilities that can be used to a player's advantage or their opponent's disadvantage. Many other rules to the game apply and are still in development.</p></div>
