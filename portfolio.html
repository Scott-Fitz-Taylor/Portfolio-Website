<p>Welcome to my creative portfolio. Below is a list of some of my favorite pieces of work I have done over the years. Enjoy!</p></div>

<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://thegreatscott.itch.io/meat-shield-wanted" target="_blank"><div id="img"><img src="Title screen 6.jpg"></a></div></a><p>'Meat-Shield: Wanted' = Individual/passion project. This was my first ever attempt at creating text-based, choose-your-own-adventure-like narrative game, which I did using Twine Harlowe initially for a univeristy project. Soon after starting the project it was clear that I had great visions for this game that were arguablly way too ambitious for someone with no prior knowledge or experience of coding whatsoever to make within a tight deadline. This is especially the case due to my desire to create and add unique artwork and music into the game. However, I was determined to complete it and make it the best game that I could, so I endeavoured every day for several months straight up until the deadline (no exaggeration). In the end I proved myself and the other doubters wrong as I recieved a score of 80, which is higher than a First! The game was also chosen by my lecturers to be shown as an exemplar to next year's students! Since then it has been a passion project that I have uploaded onto 'itch.io' If you wish to check this out then you can access it by clicking the image on the left. Enjoy :)</p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><a href="https://trinket.io/python/81f54d65ec?outputOnly=true"target="_blank"><div id="img2"><img src="Dream_Catcher3.png"></div><a></a><p>'The Dream Catcher' = Group project. This python game was made alongside two other people, Humaira and Kyle. We worked together through almost every stage of the planning process as well as certain parts of the game's creation through online communication and daily Zoom meetings. We planned for the game to have multiple different sections/dreams that the player playsthrough depending on their responses to a 'personality quiz' at the beginning of the game. This means that depending on a player's choices, they will have a different experience to other players as well as on multiple playthroughs, similar to my previous project. To achieve this, each of us split-off from the group to work on three individual sections each, which would be compiled together once written. At the end of the project, we had time to play-test the code to make sure it worked properly and as intended, however, there were so many problems that I, alone, had to go through each line of code (of the other people's sections) to correct the errors. Because of my valiant work, I was thereafter titled 'the Sweeper'... by myself. If you wish to play the game, and more importantly the sections that I made, then click the image on the left and choose the options 'Indoors', 'Fame' and 'The Unknown' when prompted, enjoy :) </p></div>
<div id="text2-1"><div id="img3"><img src="A3 PNG-min.png"></div><a></a><p>'Deadlock'/'Stalemate' boardgame (name TBD) = 100% passion project. This is a boardgame that I have been working on for a couple of months now. It is a two player game that is a hybrid beteween a boardgame and a card game. The way that the game works, at least at the moment, is that each player (with their own deck of cards) must place cards in each column while keeping their cards on their side of the river. This is because a player cannot place a card on the opponent's side, however, they can push a card from their side over the river using another one of their cards (as long as they use the appropriate card to push what is on the board). You must do this while the opponent is pushing their cards onto your side or pushing your advanced cards back. What will soon happen is a constant back and forth between both players in each column until one player successfully pushes a card off the board on the opponent's side, winning them a point. The first player to win the most columns/points wins the game. To add extra strategy, there are special cards (e.g. Jack and Queen) that have their own abilities that can be used to a player's advantage or their opponent's disadvantage. Many other rules to the game apply and are still in development.</p></div>
