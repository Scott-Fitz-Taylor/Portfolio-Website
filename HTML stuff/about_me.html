<p>Hello again. This page is to give you an insight into who I am for those that are interested. Long story short: I'm a guy who likes to make things, with the dream of my creative work (be it writing, game making, or advert concepts) being enjoyed by others, whether that be hundreds of people or just one person. This is why I have made a continuous effort to improve my ability in creative writing through my own practise as well as doing so during my English and Creative Writing degree, which I got a 2:1 in! I have also completed online courses in 'Game's Narrative Design' as well as Code Nation's 'Develop Coding' course, both of which have taught me greatly about how to go about writing and coding story-based games (amongst other technological knowledge) with different languages (e.g. Python, HTML and CSS etc.). Most recently though, I have started a Masters degree in Creative Advertising Strategy in order to learn how I can utilise my creativity and what I have learned previously in a new industry. Alongside this, I have begun creating an additional sub-portfolio for my creative advertising concepts that I have been making for @One MinuteBriefs as a hobby of mine. These concepts are also displayed on my Twitter account (link in the Portfolio and Contact Me tabs). This main portfolio, in it's entirety, will display what I have learned thus far--with future projects being added--which will hopefully display the kind of person I am, what I am capable of as well as the great potential I have. Thank you for reading! :) </p></div>
